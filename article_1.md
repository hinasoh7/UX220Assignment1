## Travel
<p>I went on a graduation trip with my friends after saving when we initially got our first professional jobs outside of co-op.</p>
<p>We went to Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>I was also able to fund a trip with my mother around the world to thank her for all the support she has given me.</p>
<p>I will continue to travel with my mother and have made her proud as the youngest and only daughter in the family.</p>
