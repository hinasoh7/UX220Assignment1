## Travel
#![NAME = PIC DESCRIPTION](nskjgsngjds.png) -- drag it into the thing
- I went on a graduation trip with my friends after saving when we initially got our first professional jobs outside of co-op.
- We went to Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong.
- I was also able to fund a trip with my mother around the world to thank her for all the support she has given me.
- I will continue to travel with my mother and have made her proud as the youngest and only daughter in the family.
